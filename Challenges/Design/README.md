# Design Challenge

Using the [mtcars](/mtcars.csv) dataset, produce two different designs to show how you would present the data on a page in a web application. 
* Designs can be UML or other markup.
* Designs can be hand drawn.
* Designs should be added to this folder of the repository.
* Add a brief description of your designs below.

# Descriptions
## Design 1
The first design shows a class diagram of different classes for the web application. The class diagram uses a MVC model to encourage the separation of functionality and ensure low coupling and high cohesion. Getters and setters are abstracted under two separate methods. This design takes into consideration that the CSV file has been converted into a database data. 
## Design 2
Design 2 shows a activity diagram of a high level view of processes that occur under different activities such as client, server and database. The design is more abstract and so does not show handshakes between client and server to establish a connection.
